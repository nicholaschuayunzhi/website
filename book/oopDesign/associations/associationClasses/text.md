#### Association Classes :three:

</div>

<div id="body">

**An _association class_ represents additional information about an association.** It is a normal class but plays a special role from a design point of view.
 
<tip-box> 

:package: A `Man` class and a `Woman` class is linked with a ‘married to’ association and there is a need to store the date of marriage. However, that data is related to the association rather than specifically owned by either the `Man` object or the `Woman` object. In such situations, an additional association class can be introduced, e.g. a `Marriage` class, to store such information.
