#### Objects as Abstractions :two:

</div>

<div id="body">

The concept of **_Objects_ in OOP is an abstraction mechanism because it allows us to abstract away the lower level details and work with bigger granularity entities** i.e. ignore details data formats and the method implementation details and work at the level of objects.

<tip-box>

:package: We can deal with a `Person` object that represents the person Adam and query the object for Adam's age instead of dealing with details such as Adamâ€™s date of birth (DoB), in what format the DoB is stored, the algorithm used to calculate the age from the DoB, etc.
