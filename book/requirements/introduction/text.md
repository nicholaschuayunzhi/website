**A _software requirement_ specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.**

A software project may be,
* a _brown-field_ project: develop a product to replace/update an existing software product
* a _green-field_ project: develop a totally new system with no precedent

In either case, requirements gathered, analyzed, specified, and managed.

Requirements come from _stakeholders_.

Identifying requirements is not as straightforward as it sounds. It is not as simple as writing a wish list.
