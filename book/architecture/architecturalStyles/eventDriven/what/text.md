**_Event-driven_ style controls the flow of the application by detecting <tooltip content="An event is a notable occurrence that happens inside or outside the software, such as the user clicking a button, a timer running out, minimizing a window, etc.">events</tooltip> from event _emitters_ and communicating those events to interested event _consumers_ .** This architectural style is often used in GUIs.

:package: When the ‘button clicked’ event occurs in a GUI, that event can be transmitted to components that are interested in reacting to that event. Similarly, events detected at a Printer port can be transmitted to components related to operating the Printer. The same event can be sent to multiple consumers too.
