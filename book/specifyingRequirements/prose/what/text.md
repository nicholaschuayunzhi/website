**A normal textual description (i.e. _prose_) can be used to describe requirements.** Prose is especially useful when describing abstract ideas such as the vision of a product.

<tip-box> 

:package: The product vision of the [TEAMMATES Project](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates) given below is described using prose.

> ## Vision
>TEAMMATES aims to become **the biggest student project in the world** (_biggest_ here refers to 'many contributors, many users, large code base, evolving over a long period'). Furthermore, it aims to serve as a training tool for Software Engineering students who want to learn SE skills in the context of **a non-trivial real software product**.

<tip-box type="warning">

Avoid using lengthy prose to describe requirements; they can be hard to follow.
