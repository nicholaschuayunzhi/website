#### Top-Down and Bottom-Up Design :four:

</div>

<div id="body">

**Multi-level design can be done in a top-down manner, bottom-up manner, or as a mix.**
* Top-down: Design the high-level design first and flesh out the lower levels later. This is especially useful when designing big and novel systems where the high-level design needs to be stable before lower levels can be designed.
* Bottom-up: Design lower level components first and put them together to create the higher-level systems later. This is not usually scalable for bigger systems. One instance where this approach might work is when designing a variations of an existing system or re-purposing existing components to build a new system.
* Mix: Design the top levels using the top-down approach but switch to a bottom-up approach when designing the bottom levels.
