#### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment :two:

</div>

<div id="body">

**An extreme application of build automation is called _continuous integration (CI)_ in which integration, building, and testing happens automatically after each code change.**

**A natural extension of CI is _Continuous Deployment (CD)_ where the changes are not only integrated continuously, but also deployed to end-users at the same time.**

<tip-box> 

:package: Some examples of CI/CD tools:

* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org)
* [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com)
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com)
