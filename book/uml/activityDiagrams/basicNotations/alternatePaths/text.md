#### Alternate Paths :two:

<div id="body">

**_Branch nodes_ shows the start of alternate paths.** Each control flow exiting a branch node has a _guard condition_ : a boolean condition that should be true for execution to take that path. Only one of the guard condition can be true at any time.
 
**_Merge nodes_ show the end of alternate paths.** 

Both branch nodes and merge nodes are diamond shapes.
