<div id="body">

**_Branch nodes_ and _merge nodes_ have the same notation: a diamond shape.** They are used to show alternative (not parallel) paths through the AD. Each control flow exiting a branch node has a _guard condition_ which : a boolean condition that should be true for execution to take that path. **only one of the alternative paths can be taken at any time**.
