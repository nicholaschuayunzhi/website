## Lectures 

TUE 1800-2130 in E3‐06‐02

* :worried: No webcast (Reason: the lecture venue does not have the webcast facility)

* The lecture will be broken into small segments (about 30 minutes) of fairly independent parts so that late comers can still follow the remainder of the lecture.

* First 15 minutes will be a recap of previous lecture or free-flow discussion so that those slightly late will not miss the beginning of the lecture proper.

* Python topics will be in the 2nd half of the lecture so that those not interested in learning Python can leave early.
