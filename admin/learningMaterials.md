## Learning materials

A customized **online text book** is used for this module. Topic coverage may not follow the exact topic sequence in the book. There are several ways for you to access the text book.
* Full version is [here]({{baseUrl}}/book-adapted/index.html): The relevant sections are embedded under the corresponding week in the [schedule page]({{baseUrl}}/schedule/index.html).
* :scroll: Printable version (excludes exercises) is [here]({{baseUrl}}/book-adapted/print.html). PDF copies of the relevant sections will be uploaded to IVLE, by Monday of each week.  You are encouraged to use the online full version when possible (instead of the printable version or the PDF version), as it has more content %%&nbsp;videos, exercises, etc.%%

[An additional **guide on programming basics**]({{baseUrl}}/programming/index.html) is provided for you to get started or programming. Contents in that guide are to help you do the programming part of the project; they are not examinable in the final exam. Furthermore, we try to use external resources as much as possible in our guide so that you can continue your learning using those resources beyond the scope of this module.

:bar_chart: **Slides** will be uploaded to IVLE _after_ the lecture. Note that lecture slides are to assist in lecture delivery only; they are ==not suitable for printing or as an exam reference==.
