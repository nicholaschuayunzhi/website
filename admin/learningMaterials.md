[An additional **guide on programming basics**]({{baseUrl}}/programming/index.html) is provided for you to get started or programming. Contents in that guide are to help you do the programming part of the project; they are not examinable in the final exam. Furthermore, we try to use external resources as much as possible in our guide so that you can continue your learning using those resources beyond the scope of this module.
