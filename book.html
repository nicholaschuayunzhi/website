        <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
          <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
          <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown
            in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
          <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil
            holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
          <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all
            the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
          <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
          <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination.
            Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
          <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth
            and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
          <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
          <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
          <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being
            perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
          <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
            It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
          <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test cases),
            and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
          <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
          <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
          <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already the
            displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
          <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper
            one, unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
          <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The obsolescence of
            an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
          <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

        <p>A software project may be,</p>

          <li>a <em>green-field</em> project: develop a totally new system with no precedent</li>

              <li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
              <li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
              <li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
              <li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>
              <li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
              <li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.

        <p><strong>Non-functional requirements are easier to miss.</strong> We should spend extra effort in digging them out as early as possible because sometimes they are critical to the success of the software. <span class="dimmed"> E.g.

        <p><strong>Requirements can be prioritized based the importance and urgency</strong>, while keeping in mind the constraints of schedule, budget, staff resources, quality goals, and other constraints.</p>
        <p>A common approach is to group requirements into priority categories. Note that all such scales are subjective, and stakeholders define the meaning of each level in the scale for the project at hand.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 An example scheme for categorizing requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Essential</code>: The product must have this requirement fulfilled else it does not get user acceptance</li>
            <li><code>Typical</code>: Most similar systems have this feature although the product can survive without it.</li>
            <li><code>Novel</code>: New features that could differentiate this product from the rest.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>📦 Other schemes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>Low</code></li>
            <li><code>Must-have</code>, <code>Nice-to-have</code>, <code>Unlikely-to-have</code></li>

          <p>📦 The requirement given below is for a Calendar application. Stakeholder of the software (e.g. product designers) might decide that keeping track of the time taken for tasks is not in the scope of the software.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The software records the actual time taken by each task and show the difference between the <em>actual</em> and <em>scheduled</em> time for the task.</li>

          <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?).
                A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
              <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
              <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
                details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
            </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low
              risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

          <p>When separating extensions from the MSS, keep in mind that the <strong>MSS should be self-contained</strong>. That is, the MSS should give us a complete usage scenario.</p>
          <p>Also note that it is not useful to mention events such as power failures or system crashes as extensions because the system cannot function beyond such catastrophic failures.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/details/images/extension.png"

        <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png"
            height="250"></tip-box>
        <tip-box type="tip">
          Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.
        </tip-box>
        <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p><img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
        <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code> is not
          to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for Modeling Behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
        <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note that there
          is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
        <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
          <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
          <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
          <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity (or an aspect) we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level (or irrelevant to that aspect).</p>
          </div>
        </tip-box>
        <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details that
          are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand.</p>

                    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity (or an aspect) we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level (or irrelevant to

          <ol>

            <p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploits models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts
              when developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation
              from model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link
              between models and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

        <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the

        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
          <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of
            squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically
            move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p><img src="/website/book/modeling/modelingStructures/objectOrientedDomainModels/images/diagram.png" height="420">
          <p></p>
          <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not
          usually in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
        <p><strong>OODMs represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem domain</strong> and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
        <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>

        <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>👎 <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
              This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
              <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
              <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>👎 <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than a 'quick try') due to these reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique. If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>👍 <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to be read, understood,
          and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own code someday.</p>

                <li>Use parentheses/braces to show grouping even when they can be skipped.</li>
                <li>Use enumerations when a certain variable can take only a small number of finite values. For example, instead of declaring the variable 'state' as an integer and using values 0,1,2 to denote the states 'starting', 'enabled', and 'disabled'
                  respectively, declare 'state' as type <code>SystemState</code> and define an enumeration <code>SystemState</code> that has values <code>'STARTING'</code>, <code>'ENABLED'</code>, and <code>'DISABLED'</code>.</li>
                <li>When statements should follow a particular order, try to make it obvious (with appropriate naming, or at least comments). For example, if you name two functions <code>'taskA()'</code> and <code>'taskB()'</code>, it is not obvious which
                  one should be called first. Contrast this with naming the functions <code>'phaseOne()'</code> and <code>'phaseTwo()'</code> instead. This is especially important when statements in one function must be called before the other one.</li>

        <p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and
          closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent
          with typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>

          <li><strong>Refactoring is not rewriting</strong>: Discarding poorly-written code entirely and re-writing it from scratch is not refactoring because refactoring needs to be done in small steps.</li>
          <li><strong>Refactoring is not bug fixing</strong>: By definition, refactoring is different from bug fixing or any other modifications that alter the external behavior (e.g. adding a feature) of the component in concern.</li>
        </ul>
        <tip-box>
          <p>💡 Improving code structure can have many secondary benefits: e.g.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>hidden bugs become easier to spot</li>
            <li>improve performance (sometimes, simpler code runs faster than complex code because simpler code is easier for the compiler to optimize).</li>
          </ul>
        </tip-box>

          <p>Refactoring Name: <strong>Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments</strong></p>
          <p>Situation: The same fragment of code is in all branches of a conditional expression.</p>
          <p>Method: Move it outside of the expression.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (isSpecialDeal()) {
    total = price * <span class="hljs-number">0.95</span>;

            <p><strong>Documentation for <em>developer-as-user</em></strong>: Software components are written by developers and used by other developers. Therefore, there is a need to document how the components are to be used. API documents form the bulk
              of this category. Writing documentation of this kind is easier because a component with a well-defined API exposes functionality in small-sized, independent and easy-to-use chunks. Examples of such documentation can be found in the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java API</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Documentation for <em>developer-as-maintainer</em></strong>: There is a need to document how a system or a component is designed, implemented and tested so that other developers can maintain and evolve the code. Writing documentation
              of the this type is harder because of the need to explain complex internal details of a non-trivial system.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use plenty of diagrams</strong>: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
          <li><strong>Use plenty of examples</strong>: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
          <li><strong>Use simple and direct explanations</strong>: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
          <li><strong>Get rid of statements that do not add value</strong>: For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
          <li><strong>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact</strong>, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the indiscriminate inclusion of diagrams without justifying
            their need, indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain something. If you want to provide additional diagrams for completeness' sake, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li>

Instead, <strong>describe the similarity in one place and emphasize only the differences in other places.</strong>          It is very annoying to see pages and pages of similar text without any indication as to how they differ from each other.</p>

        <p><strong>Most languages allow a method to encapsulate the unusual situation in an Exception object and 'throw' that object so that another piece of code can 'catch' it and deal with it.</strong> This is especially useful when code segment that
          encountered the unusual situation does not know how to deal with it.</p>
        <p><strong>Exception objects can propagate up the method call hierarchy until it is dealt with.</strong> Usually, an exception thrown by a method is caught by the caller method. If the called method does not know how to deal with the exception it
          caught, it will throw the Exception object to its own caller. If none of the callers is prepared to deal with the exception, the exceptions can propagate through the method call stack until it is received by the main method and thrown to the
          runtime, thus halting the system.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 In the code given below, <code>processArray</code> can potentially throw an <code>InvalidInputException</code>. Because of that, <code>processInput</code> method invokes <code>processArray</code> method inside a <code>try{ }</code> block
            and has a <code>catch{ }</code> block to specify what to do if the exception is actually thrown.</p><img src="/website/book/errorHandling/exceptions/how/images/processInput.png" height="320">

        <ul>
          <li>The ability to propagate error information through the call stack.</li>

          <li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast

        <p>Although both frameworks and libraries are reuse mechanisms, there are notable differences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Libraries are meant to be used ‘as is’ while frameworks are meant to be customized/extended.</strong><span class="dimmed"> e.g., writing plugins for Eclipse so that it can be used as an IDE for different languages (C++, PHP, etc.), adding modules and themes to Drupal, and adding test cases to JUnit</span>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Your code calls the library code while the framework code calls your code.</strong><strong>Frameworks use a technique called <em>inversion of control</em>, aka the “Hollywood principle”</strong> (i.e. don’t call us, we’ll call you!).
              That is, you write code that will be called by the framework, <span class="dimmed"> e.g. writing test methods that will be called by the JUnit framework.</span> In the case of libraries, your code calls libraries.</p>

        <p><strong>A <em>platform</em> provides a runtime environment for applications.</strong> A platform is often bundled with various libraries, tools, frameworks, and technologies in addition to a runtime environment but the defining characteristic
          of a software platform is the presence of a runtime environment.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 Technically, an operating system can be called a platform. For example, Windows PC is a platform for desktop applications while iOS is a platform for mobile apps.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 <strong>Two well-known examples of platforms are JavaEE and .NET</strong>, both of which sit above Operating systems layer, and are used to develop
            <trigger for="modal:enterprise-application" trigger="click">enterprise applications</trigger>. Infrastructure services such as connection pooling, load balancing, remote code execution, transaction management, authentication, security, messaging etc. are done similarly in most enterprise applications.
            Both JavaEE and .NET provide these services to applications in a customizable way without developers having to implement them from scratch every time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) is both a framework and a platform for writing enterprise applications. The runtime used by the JavaEE applications is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that can run on different Operating Systems.</li>
            <li>.NET is a similar platform and a framework. Its runtime is called CLR (Common Language Runtime) and usually used on Windows machines.</li>

        <p><strong>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over the network</strong>, rather than a product running on a local machine. This means the actual hardware and software is located at a remote location, typically, at a large server
          farm, while users access them over the network. Maintenance of the hardware and software is managed by the cloud provider while users typically pay for only the amount of services they use. This model is similar to the consumption of electricity;
          the power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users can scale up/down
          their utilization at will without having to upgrade their hardware and software. The traditional non-cloud model of computing is similar to everyone buying their own generators to create electricity for their own use.</p>

        <p>Cloud computing can deliver computing services at three levels:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) delivers computer infrastructure as a service.</strong> For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software on them. Another
              example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. <span class="dimmed"> Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS) provides a platform on which developers can build applications.</strong> Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required when using
              IaaS. Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. <span class="dimmed"> A PaaS example is the Google App Engine where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS) allows applications to be accessed over the network</strong> instead of installing them on a local machine. <span class="dimmed"> For example, Google Docs is an SaaS word processing software, while Microsoft Word is a traditional word processing software.</span></p>
          </li>
