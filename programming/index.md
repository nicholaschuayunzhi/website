# Programming Basics (with Python)

<tip-box> 

**Target audience and scope**: This learning resource targets students with minimal or no prior programming experience. As a result, it covers only a minimal set of concepts and at times present a simplified view (i.e., the reality may be more complex).

**Acknowledgements:**
* The first few sections of this learning resource follows a similar path as, and at times borrows/adapts content from or refers to companion videos of, the excellent Python resource [_Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ by Al Sweigart](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/). Readers can refer to the same book for a more detailed version of these topics.
