**Target audience and scope**: This learning resource targets students with minimal or no prior programming experience. As a result, it covers only a minimal set of concepts and at times present a simplified view (i.e., the reality may be more complex).

**Acknowledgements:**

Readers can refer to the same book for a more detailed version of these topics.
