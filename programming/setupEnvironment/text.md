#### Setting up the Programming Environment

Programming requires some specialized tools most of which are specific to the programming language being used. Some of these tools may come pre-installed in your computer, but often you need to install and configure them yourself.

:package: One online Python programming tool you can use is [repl.it](https://repl.it/repls):

* Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/repls) and signup for a free account
* Go to [https://repl.it/languages/python3](https://repl.it/languages/python3) to enter the online Python environment

Programming in Java requires minimally the [_Java Development Kit (JDK)_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) to be installed in your computer. The JDK includes tools useful for developing and testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform.
