#### Variables

>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program. <sub>--https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables</sub>

The following statement _declares_ a variable named `v` and _assigns_ it a value `5`:
```python
v = 5
``` 

Here are some more examples:
```python
price = 10.50
is_new = True
name = "John Doe"
```
