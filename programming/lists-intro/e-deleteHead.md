#### Exercise : Delete Head, Delete Tail

Complete the functions as described below:
* `delete_head(item_list)`: deletes the first item in the list passed as `item_list` parameter.
* `delete_tail(item_list)`: deletes the last item in the list passed as `item_list` parameter.

:bulb: `pass` is a dummy statement that does nothing. We use it here because Python does not accept empty functions.
